# 🚀 Void-HTML

**Void-HTML** is a lightweight microblogging and social networking platform built with Go, Fiber, and server-rendered HTML. Inspired by the "Laravel Bootcamp" approach, Void-HTML takes a deep dive into building robust web applications using Go's performance and simplicity while adhering to clean architecture principles.

This repository is the HTML version of the Void platform. A separate repository (e.g., Void-Inertia or Void-Vue) is planned for a more dynamic, client-driven front-end using Inertia/Vue.

## 📌 Overview

Void-HTML is designed to be a minimalistic yet fully functional microblogging platform. Its primary focus is to:

- 🏠 Allow users to register, login, and manage their profiles.
- 📝 Enable users to post "shouts" (short messages) and view a global feed.
- 🔔 Provide a robust notification system using RabbitMQ for real-time interactions.
- 🏗 Serve as a learning ground for modern web development patterns, inspired by frameworks like Laravel but leveraging the speed of Go.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **User Authentication & Session Management**  
  Secure registration, login, and logout functionality. Sessions are managed via custom middleware to ensure that user credentials and sessions are managed reliably.

- 🖥 **Server-Rendered HTML**  
  Uses Fiber's HTML templating engine to render pages on the server side, making it a great starting point for projects that rely on traditional multi-page application (MPA) patterns.

- 🔔 **Real-Time Notifications**  
  Leverages RabbitMQ to implement an asynchronous notification system that informs users about new shouts and interactions.

- 💬 **Microblogging Capabilities**  
  Users can post shouts, view a global feed, and interact through "echoes" (replies), all managed via RESTful endpoints and rendered templates.

- 🎨 **Profile Customization**  
  Each user has a customizable profile complete with a bio and avatar upload functionality. Images are processed using the imaging library for resizing.

- 🗄 **ORM-Based Data Management**  
  Built on GORM and SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval with minimal configuration.

## 🏗 Architecture & Design

### 📦 Modular Structure

Void-HTML is structured into clearly defined modules:
- 📁 **cmd/server:** Contains the main application entry point.
- 📁 **internal:** Houses the core business logic including:
  - 🗄 **db:** Database initialization and migrations.
  - ⚡ **events:** Event definitions and publisher.
  - 🌐 **handlers:** HTTP route handlers for different functionalities (authentication, user management, shouts, notifications).
  - 🔐 **middleware:** Custom middleware for session management and authentication checks.
  - 📝 **models:** GORM models for Users, Shouts, Echoes, and Notifications.
  - 📢 **services/notifications:** Logic for processing and sending notifications.
- 📁 **pkg:** Contains reusable packages like RabbitMQ integration and session management.
- 📁 **web:** Contains static assets and HTML templates.

### 🛡 Middleware & Session Management

User authentication is managed using middleware:
- 🔑 **GetUserFromSession:** Retrieves the user ID from the session (using a custom session package) and stores it in the request context under `c.Locals("UserID")`.
- 🚪 **RequireLogin:** Ensures that endpoints requiring authentication have a valid user ID. If not, it redirects to the login page.

This flow ensures that all route handlers can safely rely on the presence of a valid user ID without directly handling session logic.

### 📢 Notifications & Event-Driven Architecture

When a new shout is created:
1. 📝 The shout is saved to the database.
2. 📡 An event is generated (conforming to the `ShoutEvent` interface).
3. 📨 The event is marshaled to JSON and published via RabbitMQ.
4. 🔔 A separate service consumes these notifications and sends real-time alerts to users (excluding the shout's author).

This decoupled, event-driven architecture allows for scalability and a responsive user experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🔵 **Go:** The primary programming language, offering simplicity and performance.
- 🚀 **Fiber:** A fast, Express-inspired web framework for Go.
- 🗄 **GORM:** An ORM library that simplifies database interactions.
- 🛢 **SQLite:** A lightweight and self-contained SQL database engine.
- 📨 **RabbitMQ:** A robust message broker used for asynchronous event handling and notifications.
- 🖥 **HTML Templating:** Server-side rendering using HTML templates for dynamic content delivery.
- 🖼 **Imaging:** A Go package for image processing (resizing avatars).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚙ Prerequisites

- 🟢 **Go 1.23.1** or later installed.
- 📡 **RabbitMQ:** Running locally or accessible via network.
- 💡 Basic familiarity with Go modules and command-line operations.

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Void-HTML.git
   cd Void-HTML
   ```

2. **Download dependencies:**

   ```sh
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Configuration:**

   Update the RabbitMQ connection string in `cmd/server/main.go` if needed:

   ```go
   if err := rabbitmq.Init("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/"); err != nil { ... }
   ```

4. **Running the Application**

You can run the application using Air for live reloading during development:

```sh
air
```

Or build and run manually:

```sh
go build -o void ./cmd/server
./void
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
